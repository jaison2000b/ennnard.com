  <h1>Steve's 90s website</h1>
  <p>As part of my <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web">Programming and the Web for Beginners</a> course from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> I've been asked to write a static website using html amd css. 
  </p>
  <p>
  That's pretty 90s, I thought, so I decided to make a website which celebrates the best of 1990s website design.
